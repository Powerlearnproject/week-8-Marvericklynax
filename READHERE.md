# SDG Project: Solving SDG 3 - Good Health and Well-Being

## Problem Definition
This project addresses the issue of **limited access to healthcare in rural areas**, particularly in developing countries. The goal is to analyze healthcare resource distribution, such as the availability of hospitals, doctors, and treatments, in rural versus urban areas. This project will help understand how healthcare access can be improved in under-served regions by analyzing data related to healthcare facilities and personnel.

## Integration Process
The data was stored in an SQL database, consisting of hospitals, doctors, patients, and treatments. We exported this data from the SQL database and imported it into Microsoft Excel. Excel tools like PivotTables and charts were used for further analysis.

The integration process:
1. SQL queries were executed to retrieve the necessary data.
2. The retrieved data was exported as a CSV file.
3. The CSV file was imported into Excel for analysis.
4. Data consistency was verified during the import process.
